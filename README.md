## Description
My first react app to get a feel for things.  I've utilized FlexBox and added logic to pull in random images of each breed available from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

## Getting Started

run `yarn` or `npm` from the root directory to install the dependencies, then `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the app locally
